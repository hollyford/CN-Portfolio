    <h3>Why did I join CodeNation?</h3>
    <p>
      It has always been a wish of mine to be able to code. For a number of
      reasons, this never happened. <br />In January 2020 I finally did
      something about this and embarked on a journey which has led me here!
      <br />I completed a Full Stack Web Developer course, which I achieved a
      Second Class Honours Diploma. <br />But, I found that this didn't provide
      me with all of the tools I needed to actually make a career change.
      <br />Then came the apprenticeship with Capital One!
